dArk (decentralized Ark) is an ARK implementation based on institutional blockchain nodes, organized in one or more interoperable networks. The power of this technological foundation lies in the fact that the data is owned, stored, and controlled not by a single organization but by all participants in a “public good” network.

The long-term objective is to provide an open and non-centralized unique/deduplicated persistent identifier factory and resolution service for the global Open Science ecosystem, based on permissioned public blockchain technology.

ARK identifier has emerged as a viable, low-cost alternative solution due to the potential implementation of internal providers for the global resolver.

Some of the motivations for this project are as follows:

(i) The need for not only persistent but also unique/deduplicated identifiers to build more robust research graphs, indicators, and research assessment inputs. 

(ii) Lack of PID coverage in Global South repositories primarily due to the costs associated with those services for institutions. 

(iii) Most persistent identifier systems are based on centralized models, relying on a few agencies that support the service infrastructure.

This development is not intended to be a replacement or competition for DOI identifiers/agencies but as a complementary solution that will also be interoperable with DOI providers.
