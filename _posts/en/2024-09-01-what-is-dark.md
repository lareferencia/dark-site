**dARK** is a decentralized implementation of ARK that assigns and resolves ARK identifiers through institutional blockchain nodes.  

**dARK** operates on a **"public good"** network where **data ownership, storage, and control** are distributed among all participating organizations. The innital project was primarily hosted and funded by the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (IBICT), with additional support from LA Referencia, made possible thanks to the backing of the Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services (SCOSS) pledges.

The current version provides:  

- An **initial implementation of decentralized ARK** based on a lightweight private blockchain network  
- **Fault-tolerant decentralized attribution and resolution of ARK identifiers**  
- **An aggregator-level ARK attribution system** for legacy research production in the Brazilian open science ecosystem (OasisBr, IBICT Brazil)  

### Motivation  

1. The ARK identifier has emerged as a **viable, low-cost alternative solution** thanks to the potential implementation of local providers for the global resolver.  
2. **Need for unique and persistent identifiers** to build more robust research graphs, indicators, and research assessment inputs.  
3. **Lack of persistent identifier coverage** in Global South repositories, primarily due to the costs associated with these services for institutions.  
4. Most persistent identifier systems are **based on centralized models**, relying on a few agencies that support the service infrastructure.  

### Long-term Objectives  

- Providing an **open and non-centralized system for unique/deduplicated persistent identifiers**  
- Offering a **decentralized resolution service** for the Open Science ecosystem, interoperable with other PID services (such as DOI agencies)  
- Ensuring the **decentralized preservation** of metadata associated with digital objects referenced by ARK identifiers, aiming to provide **consistent PIDs and metadata** to research graphs (OpenAIRE, OpenAlex, among others)
