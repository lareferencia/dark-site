<p class="lead-highlight">
  <strong>dARK</strong> is a decentralized implementation of <a href="https://arks.org" target="_blank">Archival Resource Key (ARK)</a> that assigns and resolves ARK identifiers through institutional blockchain nodes. It operates on a <strong>"public good"</strong> network where <strong>data ownership, storage, and control</strong> are distributed among all participating organizations.
</p>

The initial project was primarily hosted and funded by the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (IBICT), with additional support from LA Referencia, made possible thanks to the backing of the Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services (SCOSS) pledges.

      <h4>ARK Persistent Identifier</h4>
      <p>The ARK identifier has emerged as a <strong>viable, low-cost alternative</strong> due to the possibility of implementing local providers for the global resolver. Its use facilitates <strong>long-term access and preservation</strong> of digital resources, ensuring stable and reliable links.</p>

      <h4>Research Assessment</h4>
      <p><strong>Persistent identifiers are essential</strong> for building more robust research graphs, generating accurate indicators, and improving the evaluation of scientific output. Their ability to link various information objects enhances the analysis and understanding of research impact.</p>

      <h4>Challenges in the Global South</h4>
      <p>In Global South countries, the <strong>lack of persistent identifier coverage</strong> is a common issue. This is primarily due to the costs associated with these services, limiting access to essential infrastructures for ensuring the visibility and preservation of research outputs.</p>

      <h4>Need for Decentralization</h4>
      <p>Currently, most persistent identifier systems operate under <strong>centralized models</strong>, relying on a few agencies to maintain service infrastructure. A decentralized approach, such as the one proposed by dARK, reduces this dependency and increases system resilience, promoting greater equity in access and management of identifiers.</p>

<h2 class="custom-heading">Long-term Objectives</h2>

<div class="architecture-details">
  <div class="detail-box">
    <h4>Open Infrastructure</h4>
    <p>Providing an <strong>open and non-centralized system for unique/deduplicated persistent identifiers</strong> accessible to all</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="detail-box">
    <h4>Resolution Services</h4>
    <p>Offering a <strong>decentralized resolution service</strong> for the Open Science ecosystem, interoperable with other PID services (such as DOI agencies)</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="detail-box">
    <h4>Metadata Preservation</h4>
    <p>Ensuring the <strong>decentralized preservation</strong> of metadata associated with digital objects referenced by ARK identifiers, aiming to provide <strong>consistent PIDs and metadata</strong> to research graphs (OpenAIRE, OpenAlex, among others)</p>

  <div class="note-content">
    <p>This development is not intended to replace or compete with DOI identifiers/agencies, but to serve as a complementary solution that will also be interoperable with DOI providers.</p>
